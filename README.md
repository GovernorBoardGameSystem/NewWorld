This is the base game for the Governor Board Game system.

Islands have been discovered in a brave new world. Tales of wealth and fertility have spread across Europe. The nobility is in a race to carve out control over this exciting land. 

Longing for adventure and a better life, you have gained favor with your king's court and been given a commission to govern a small settlement in the New World.

Make difficult decisions, engage in cunning intrigue, and weather adversity to grow your territory and gain favor with the king's court. The king will surely notice your efforts and knight you.
