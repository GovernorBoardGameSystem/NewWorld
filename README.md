1. Pier
2. Town
3. Mill

#Round
There are 3 phases to every round: Passage of time, Action & Resolution.

-Passage of time: Ocean trade is advanced and event cards are drawn face-down.
-Action: Player simultaneously perform actions for a set amount of time.
-Resolution: Any conflicts from actions are resolved, deferred events are resolved and queued events are played in sequence.

#Round 0
Round 0 is a special round where players establish their settlements. All players may stake a claim at the same time, but must adhere to the following rule: 

Two players cannot settle within 4 hex positions of each other.

Resolve conflict in Round 0 by sacrificing favor, a negative value of favor is possible. the person sacrificing the most favor would get first choice. Losing parties would not lose favor. 

#Passage of Time Phase
Passage of time is the phase where ocean trade is performed, crops are grown and event cards are queued up according to progress of the settlement.

Ocean trade: This is performed in 3 parts.
1 - Move supplies from ocean to pier
2 - Optionally convert favor to suplies in ocean
3 - Convert goods to favor in king's court, according to demand per good.

Crop Growth: You may place any distribution of goods on your pier that you have plantations for. 

Queue Events: Draw an event card for every feature in your settlement. 3 is the minimum anount of cards you may draw.


#Actions Phase
The Actions phase is a timed phase. Start the 5 minute timer when there are no more passage of time items and players are ready.

Actions are performed as follows: discard a queued event card face down, then you may perform an action. Every action must be unique per round.

Actions available depend on your settlement progress.
